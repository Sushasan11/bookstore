    What was built:
    - /orders page with paginated order history showing date, total, and item summary
    - Clickable order rows navigating to /orders/{id} with full item details and price snapshots
    - /account hub page with email display and Order History nav card
    - Account link in desktop Header nav and mobile hamburger menu

    How to verify:
    Prerequisites: Backend running (`cd backend && poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload`), frontend running (`cd frontend && npm run dev`). Log in with a test account that has at least one order.

    **SHOP-07: Order History**
    1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/orders
    2. Verify the page shows "Order History" heading
    3. Verify each order row displays: Order #ID, date (e.g. "February 28, 2026"), item summary (e.g. "2 items: Book Title, +1 more"), and total price
    4. If you have >10 orders, verify pagination controls (Previous/Next) appear and work
    5. If you have 0 orders, verify "No orders yet" empty state with "Browse Books" link

    **SHOP-08: Order Detail Navigation**
    6. Click any order row in the list
    7. Verify you navigate to /orders/{id} showing the full item list
    8. Verify each item shows title, author, quantity, unit price, and line total
    9. Verify the order total is displayed
    10. Verify "View All Orders" button navigates back to /orders

    **Account Hub**
    11. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/account
    12. Verify the page shows "My Account" heading and your email
    13. Verify an "Order History" card is displayed and links to /orders

    **Navigation**
    14. On desktop: verify "Account" link appears in the header nav bar
    15. On mobile (narrow viewport): open hamburger menu and verify "Account" appears in the nav drawer

    **Auth Protection**
    16. Open an incognito window and navigate to /orders — verify redirect to /login
    17. In the same incognito window, navigate to /account — verify redirect to /login
