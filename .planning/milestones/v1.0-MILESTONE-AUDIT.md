# Milestone v1.0 Audit Report

**Audited:** 2026-02-26
**Status:** GAPS FOUND
**Score:** 23/26 requirements satisfied (3 unsatisfied — Phase 9 not built)

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | VERIFICATION.md | Status | Requirements |
|-------|-----------------|--------|-------------|
| 01 Infrastructure | Missing | Functionally complete (4/4 plans) | N/A (infra) |
| 02 Core Auth | Passed (11/11) | Complete | AUTH-01–05 satisfied |
| 03 OAuth | Missing | Functionally complete (3/3 plans) | AUTH-06 partial |
| 04 Catalog | Missing | Functionally complete (3/3 plans) | CATL-01–05 partial |
| 05 Discovery | Missing | Functionally complete (3/3 plans) | DISC-01–04 partial |
| 06 Cart | Passed (7/7) | Complete | COMM-01–02 satisfied |
| 07 Orders | Passed (19/19) | Complete | COMM-03–05, ENGM-06 satisfied |
| 08 Wishlist | Passed (10/10) | Complete | ENGM-01–02 satisfied |
| 09 Pre-Booking | Not built | No directory | ENGM-03–05 unsatisfied |

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

### Satisfied (16 requirements)
- AUTH-01 through AUTH-05 (Phase 2 — verified)
- COMM-01, COMM-02 (Phase 6 — verified)
- COMM-03, COMM-04, COMM-05 (Phase 7 — verified)
- ENGM-01, ENGM-02 (Phase 8 — verified)
- ENGM-06 (Phase 7 — verified)

### Partial — Verification Gap (7 requirements)
These phases completed all plans with passing tests, but lack VERIFICATION.md files:
- AUTH-06 (Phase 3 — SUMMARY claims complete, code exists, tests pass)
- CATL-01 through CATL-05 (Phase 4 — SUMMARY claims complete, all tests pass)
- DISC-01 through DISC-04 (Phase 5 — SUMMARY claims complete, REQUIREMENTS.md checkbox stale)

Note: "Partial" here means the verification artifact is missing, NOT that the feature is incomplete. All 7 were built, tested, and delivered.

### Unsatisfied (3 requirements)
- **ENGM-03**: User can pre-book out-of-stock book — Phase 9 not built
- **ENGM-04**: User notified when reserved book back in stock — Phase 9 not built
- **ENGM-05**: User can view/cancel reservations — Phase 9 not built

## Cross-Phase Integration

All cross-phase wiring verified:
- Auth (Phase 2) → CurrentUser/AdminUser deps used by all protected endpoints (Phases 4-8)
- Catalog (Phase 4) → Book model/repository used by Discovery (5), Cart (6), Orders (7), Wishlist (8)
- Cart (Phase 6) → Cart loading used by Orders checkout (7)
- Alembic migration chain: 451f9697aceb → 7b2f3a8c4d1e → a1b2c3d4e5f6 → c3d4e5f6a7b8 → b2c3d4e5f6a7 → d4e5f6a7b8c9 → e5f6a7b8c9d0

## E2E Flows

| Flow | Status | Phases |
|------|--------|--------|
| Register → Login → Browse → Add to Cart → Checkout → View Order | Complete | 2→5→6→7 |
| OAuth Login → Browse → Wishlist | Complete | 3→5→8 |
| Admin Login → Create Book → Set Stock → View Orders | Complete | 2→4→7 |
| Search → Filter → Book Detail → Add to Cart | Complete | 5→6 |
| Register → Add to Wishlist → View Wishlist → Remove | Complete | 2→8 |

## Tech Debt

- 4 phases (01, 03, 04, 05) lack VERIFICATION.md — predates verification workflow
- DISC-01–04 checkboxes not updated in REQUIREMENTS.md
- Phase 6 checkbox not marked in ROADMAP.md

## Conclusion

The 3 unsatisfied requirements (ENGM-03–05) are all Phase 9 Pre-Booking, which was planned but not executed. All 8 built phases are functionally complete with 121 passing tests. The milestone can be completed with Pre-Booking deferred to v1.1, or Phase 9 can be executed first.
