## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Admin dashboard UI | Deferred to v3.1+ — separate layouts, access control, components |
| GitHub OAuth on frontend | Email + Google covers majority of users |
| Real payment gateway (Stripe) | Mock payment sufficient; PCI scope is a separate milestone |
| Mobile app | Web-first, API-only |
| Real-time stock notifications | Backend is email-only for restock alerts |
| Infinite scroll on catalog | Pagination is better UX for e-commerce (Baymard Institute) |
| Client-only localStorage cart | Server is source of truth; breaks cross-device |
| Recommendation engine | Needs transaction data first |
